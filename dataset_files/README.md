## -Omics files


**VCFs**: See [1000 Genomes on GRCh38](https://www.internationalgenome.org/data-portal/data-collection/grch38) for vcf data. Files are expected to be divided by sample rather than by chromosome. Do this yourself, or run [this otherwise deprecated script](../sample.vcf.sh) to produce 1000 genomes vcf files covering chromosome 22 only (in GRCh37). 

**Bigwigs**: Bigwig files referred to in the dataset are downloable from IHEC here: ([1](https://epigenomesportal.ca/tracks/CEEHRC/hg19/51570.CEEHRC.MS002001.RNA-Seq.signal_forward.bigWig) [2](https://epigenomesportal.ca/tracks/CEEHRC/hg19/51571.CEEHRC.MS002001.RNA-Seq.signal_reverse.bigWig) [3](https://epigenomesportal.ca/tracks/CEEHRC/hg19/51598.CEEHRC.MS002201.RNA-Seq.signal_forward.bigWig))
